# MBTA accessibility tools

Inspired by [this request on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/95cc5o/is_there_an_app_for_the_mbta_that_tells_you_if/) for accessibility alerts grouped by station, and indicators of which green line car to board.

Code is very messy, but happy to share. Uses the MBTA v3 API.
